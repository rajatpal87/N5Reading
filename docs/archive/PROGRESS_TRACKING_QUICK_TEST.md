## 🎯 What to Test

### **1. Audio Extraction Progress** 🎵

**Steps:**
1. Upload or use an existing video with status "✅ Uploaded"
2. Click "🎵 Extract Audio" button
3. **Observe:**
   - Status changes to "🎵 Extracting Audio..."
   - Progress bar appears (0% → 100%)
   - Status message: "Extracting audio from video..."
   - Time estimate: "~20-30s remaining"
   - **Auto-updates every 2 seconds!**

**Expected Timeline:**
```
0s    → 10%  "Extracting audio..."
10s   → 25%  "Extracting audio..."
20s   → 65%  "Extracting audio..."
30s   → 100% "Audio extraction complete" ✅
```

### **2. Transcription Progress** 📝

**Steps:**
1. Use a video with status "🎵 Audio Extracted"
2. Click "📝 Transcribe & Translate" button
3. **Observe:**

**If audio file > 25MB:**
```
Step 1: Compression
├─ Status: "🗜️ Compressing..."
├─ Progress: 0% → 100%
├─ Message: "Compressing audio (35.5MB → 5.6MB)..."
└─ Time: ~3-5 seconds

Step 2: Transcription
├─ Status: "📝 Transcribing..."
├─ Progress: 0% → 50% → 100%
├─ Message: "Transcribing Japanese audio..."
└─ Time: ~40-60 seconds (for 19-min video)
```

**If audio file < 25MB:**
```
Status: "📝 Transcribing..."
Progress: 0% → 50% → 100%
Message: "Transcribing Japanese audio..."
Time: video_duration * 2.5 seconds
```

### **3. Translation Progress** 🌏 (Most Impressive!)

**This is the most detailed progress tracking!**

**Observe:**
```
Status: "🌏 Translating..."
Progress: Increases every 5 segments

Updates:
0:00  →  5%  "Translating segment 5/96..."  (~9s remaining)
0:01  → 10%  "Translating segment 10/96..." (~8s remaining)
0:02  → 20%  "Translating segment 20/96..." (~7s remaining)
0:03  → 30%  "Translating segment 30/96..." (~6s remaining)
...
0:09  → 85%  "Translating segment 82/96..." (~1s remaining)
0:10  → 100% "Translation complete" ✅
```

**Why It's So Accurate:**
- We translate segments one-by-one in a loop
- We know: current_segment / total_segments
- Real-time progress calculation!
- Updates visible every 5 segments

## 🎥 Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Fresh Upload → Full Pipeline**
```
1. Upload new video
   Status: "✅ Uploaded" (green)
   
2. Click "🎵 Extract Audio"
   → Watch progress: 0% → 100% (~30s)
   Status: "🎵 Audio Extracted" (purple)
   
3. Click "📝 Transcribe & Translate"
   → Phase A: Transcription 0% → 100% (~40s)
   → Phase B: Translation 0% → 100% (~10s)

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ **Auto-Polling**
- Open browser console (F12)
- You should see: `📊 Auto-polling enabled - videos are processing`
- Network tab should show `/api/videos` requests every 2 seconds
- **Polling stops automatically when all videos complete!**

### ✅ **Progress Updates**
- Progress bar fills smoothly from left to right
- Percentage increases from 0% → 100%
- Status message changes based on stage
- Time remaining decreases (countdown)

### ✅ **Status Badges**
- Badges animate (pulse) during processing
- Colors change based on status:
  - 🟢 Green: Uploaded
  - 🟡 Yellow: Extracting Audio (animated)
  - 🟣 Purple: Audio Extracted
  - 🟠 Orange: Transcribing (animated)
  - 🔵 Indigo: Translating (animated)
  - 🔷 Cyan: Analyzing
  - 🔴 Red: Error

### ✅ **Time Estimates**
- Audio extraction: `~20-30s`
- Compression: `~3-5s`
- Transcription: `~40-60s` (for 19-min video)
- Translation: `~10-15s` (for 96 segments)

## 🐛 Known Behaviors

### **Progress May Jump:**
- Audio extraction progress is estimated (FFmpeg doesn't provide real progress)
- It smoothly animates from 10% → 90% over estimated duration
- This is expected and acceptable for MVP

### **Transcription Progress Stays at 50%:**
- OpenAI Whisper API doesn't provide progress
- We show 50% as "in progress" indicator
- This is expected (black box API)

### **Translation Is Most Accurate:**
- Real segment-by-segment tracking
- Updates every 5 segments for efficiency
- This is the gold standard! 🏆

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Want to See Slower Progress?**
- Use a longer video (>10 minutes)
- Progress will be more visible

### **Want to See Compression?**
- Use a video that creates >25MB audio file
- Typically: videos >10 minutes with high-quality audio

### **Want to See Many Updates?**
- Upload a video with lots of speech
- More segments = more translation progress updates
