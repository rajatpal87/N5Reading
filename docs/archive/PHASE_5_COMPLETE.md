## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Timeline Generation Algorithm
1. Divide video into 15-second segments
2. For each segment:
   - Count N5 words appearing in that time range
   - Count grammar patterns
   - Calculate total words
   - Calculate N5 density = (N5 words / total words) * 100
3. Categorize as high/medium/low based on density
4. Sort by density and return top 5 segments

### Export Service
- Generates CSV with UTF-8 BOM for Excel compatibility
- Groups vocabulary by word_id to calculate frequency
- Sanitizes special characters for CSV format
- Supports multiple export formats (standard, Anki)

### Performance Optimizations
- Memo-ized sorting and filtering in vocabulary table
- Efficient timeline segment rendering
- Lazy loading of dashboard components
- Optimized database queries with JOINs

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Backend
1. **Data structure matters**: Had to debug incorrect property names (`.vocabulary.words` vs `.vocabulary_matches`)
2. **Input validation essential**: Added checks for array types in export functions
3. **Timeline granularity**: 15-second segments provide good balance of detail and performance

### Frontend
1. **Component composition**: Breaking dashboard into small components made development faster
2. **useMemo optimization**: Essential for sorting/filtering large vocabulary lists
3. **Click-to-jump**: Universal pattern for timestamps greatly improves UX

### Integration
1. **Route structure**: `/dashboard/:id` sits naturally between home and video player
2. **Export via window.open**: Simplest approach for triggering CSV downloads
3. **Color consistency**: Using Tailwind's built-in colors maintains visual coherence
