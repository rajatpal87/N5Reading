## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Tests

#### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","message":"N5 Reading API is running",...}
```

#### 2. Video List (Empty)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/videos
# Expected: {"videos":[]}
```

#### 3. Upload Video (with cURL)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/videos/upload \
  -F "video=@/path/to/your/video.mp4"
# Expected: {"message":"Video uploaded successfully","video":{...}}
```

#### 4. Video List (After Upload)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/videos
# Expected: {"videos":[{id:1, filename:..., duration:..., ...}]}
```

#### 5. Get Single Video
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/videos/1
# Expected: {"video":{id:1, filename:..., ...}}
```

#### 6. Delete Video
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/videos/1
# Expected: {"message":"Video deleted successfully"}
```

### Frontend Tests

#### 1. Open Application
```
http://localhost:5173
```

#### 2. Upload Video
- Drag and drop a video file OR click to browse
- See upload progress bar
- See success message
- Video appears in list below

#### 3. File Validation
- Try uploading a non-video file (e.g., .txt)
  - Expected: Error message "Invalid file type..."
- Try uploading a file > 100MB
  - Expected: Error message "File too large..."

#### 4. Video List
- See uploaded videos in grid
- Check metadata displays correctly
- Click "Delete" button
- Confirm video is removed

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **FFmpeg Optional**: If FFmpeg is not installed, video duration will show as 0, but upload still works
2. **No Thumbnails**: Video thumbnails are placeholders (will be implemented in Phase 2)
3. **No YouTube URL**: URL import will be added in Phase 2
4. **No Processing Queue**: Videos are uploaded but not yet analyzed (Phase 3)
5. **No Pagination**: All videos load at once (add pagination if list grows large)

---

## 🔜 Next Phase

**Phase 2: Video Processing Pipeline**
- YouTube URL download (yt-dlp)
- Audio extraction (FFmpeg)
- Background job queue (Bull + Redis)
- Processing status updates
- Video thumbnail generation
