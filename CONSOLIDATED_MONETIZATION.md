- Mix of tiers

**Revenue Breakdown:**
```

## 💡 Unit Economics

### Per Free User (2 videos/month)
```
Processing Cost:
- Audio extraction:   $0 (local FFmpeg)
- Transcription:      2 × 5min × $0.006 = $0.06
- Translation:        $0 (free tier)
- Storage:            $0.001
Total Cost:           $0.06/month

Revenue:              $0
Net:                  -$0.06/month per free user
```

**Analysis:** Acceptable loss for conversion funnel. 500 free users = -$30/month.

### Per Paid N5 User
```
Processing Cost:
- API costs:          $3-6/month (varies by usage)
- Storage:            $0.10/month
- Bandwidth:          $0.05/month
Total Cost:           $3.15-6.15/month

Revenue:              $9.99/month
Stripe Fee:           -$0.59 (2.9% + $0.30)
Net Revenue:          $9.40/month

Gross Profit:         $3.25-6.25/month
Gross Margin:         35-66%
```

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Single-Tier Model (N5 only):**
```
Monthly Price:        $9.99
Avg Subscription:     12 months
Churn Rate:           5%/month
Lifetime:             20 months (1 / 0.05)

LTV = $9.99 × 20 = $199.80
```

**Multi-Tier Model (Progressive):**
```
N5 (6 months):        $9.99 × 6  = $59.94
N4 (6 months):        $14.99 × 6 = $89.94
N3 (12 months):       $19.99 × 12 = $239.88
Total LTV:            $389.76 (24 months)

Alternative Path:
N5 (12 months):       $9.99 × 12  = $119.88
N4 (12 months):       $14.99 × 12 = $179.88
Total LTV:            $299.76 (24 months)
```

**Multi-Tier Advantage:** **2-3x higher LTV** ($300-400 vs $120-200)
