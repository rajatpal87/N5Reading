## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not charge in MVP?
**A**: Focus on product quality first. Validate that people want it before adding payment complexity.

### Q: Why $9.99 instead of $4.99 or $19.99?

## 🚀 Multi-Tier Advantage Summary

### Why This Model is Superior

#### 1. **Natural Upgrade Path**
- Users progress through JLPT levels as they learn Japanese
- Each tier unlocks new analysis capabilities
- Clear value at each step: N5 → N4 → N3 → N2 → N1
- Learning journey = 2-4 years = sustained revenue

#### 2. **Higher Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
- **Simple model**: $9.99 × 12 months = $119.88 LTV
- **Multi-tier model**: $9.99×6 + $14.99×6 + $19.99×12 = **$389.76** (2 years)
- **Dedicated learner**: Full journey = **$600-800 LTV** (3-4 years)
- **3-6x higher LTV than single-tier**

#### 3. **Reduced Churn**
- Single-tier: 5% monthly churn (users complete N5 → leave)
- Multi-tier: 2% monthly churn (commitment to learning journey)
- Users invested in progress across multiple levels
- Sunk cost fallacy works in our favor

#### 4. **Better Revenue Predictability**
- N5-only platform: $120K/year (1,000 subs)
- Multi-tier platform: $333K/year (1,800 mixed subs)
- **2.7x revenue with same total user base**
- Diversified revenue across tiers = stability

#### 5. **Clear Differentiation**
- Each tier has obvious value: New JLPT level access
- Not abstract "premium features" but concrete learning progression
- Easy to explain: "Upgrade when you're ready for N4"
- Psychological alignment with learner identity

#### 6. **Scales with User Skill**
- Beginners pay less ($9.99) → affordable entry point
- Advanced learners pay more ($29.99) → can afford it, get more value
- Fair value exchange at every level
- Lower barrier to entry, higher ceiling

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture for Multi-Tier

### Database Design ✅
- `jlpt_vocabulary` table with `jlpt_level` column (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
- `grammar_patterns` table with `jlpt_level` column
- `users.max_jlpt_level` determines access
- `user_jlpt_progress` tracks mastery per level
- **Already designed for extensibility**

### Access Control
```javascript
// Check if user can access content at this JLPT level
function canAccessLevel(user, requiredLevel) {
  // Lower number = higher level (N1=1, N5=5)
  return user.max_jlpt_level <= requiredLevel;
}

// Example: N4 subscriber (max_jlpt_level=4) can access N4 and N5
canAccessLevel(user, 5); // true (N5)
canAccessLevel(user, 4); // true (N4)
canAccessLevel(user, 3); // false (N3 requires upgrade)
```

### Analysis Engine
```javascript
// Filter vocabulary by user's subscription tier
const detectedWords = await db.query(`
  SELECT * FROM jlpt_vocabulary 
  WHERE jlpt_level >= ? 
  AND (kanji IN (?) OR hiragana IN (?))
`, [user.max_jlpt_level, tokens, tokens]);

// Only show JLPT levels user has access to
```

### Upgrade Prompts
```javascript
// Trigger upgrade suggestion when user reaches 70% mastery
const n5Progress = await getUserProgress(userId, 5);
const masteryPercent = (n5Progress.words_known / n5Progress.total_words) * 100;

if (masteryPercent >= 70 && user.subscription_tier === 'n5_monthly') {
  showUpgradeToN4Modal();
}
```
